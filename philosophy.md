          <h1>Philosophy</h1>
          <p>The Baltimore Rescue Mission has been reaching out to the poor of inner city Baltimore since 1956.  We are a Christian, nonprofit, non-denominational Gospel ministry.  Our primary objective is the evangelization of every person who enters the mission.</p><p>Secondly, our goal is to provide food, clothing, shelter, and a five-day drug and alcohol detox.  The detox unit is designed to accommodate alcohol and drug addicted men in their most desperate condition.</p><p>We are able to house 200 men and 43 women and children each evening.  We provide 500+ meals daily and everything is provided to our guests free of charge.</p><p>We are a <strong>faith ministry</strong>, relying on the Lordâ€™s provision.  The mission receives no government funding or government surplus foods, charges nothing to the people who come (regardless of the length of stay), and has no clothing store, but rather gives away freely all donated clothing.  God supports the mission through churches, individuals, and businesses, in answer to the <strong>prayer of faith.</strong></p>
