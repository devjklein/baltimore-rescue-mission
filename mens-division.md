          <h1>Men's Division</h1>
          <p>The Men’s Division is an emergency overnight shelter for homeless men 18 years old and up that provides food, clothing, shelter, showers, and a one-hour gospel service each evening.  We also provide a five-day drug and alcohol detoxification program and a New Convert’s Class Monday through Friday in the evenings.  Because the men’s division is a larger facility, we do not limit how many nights a man can stay at the men’s division.</p>
